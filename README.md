An Android TV application used to configure your Wifi Access Point (for Android L only, this wont work on Android M)

![screenshot](screen/screen.gif)

This application uses private API for enabling/disabling Access Point. It may not be working on your Android TV

## Requirements

Android TV 5.0 (sdk 21) or Android TV 5.1.1 (sdk 22)

## Pros & Cons

Pros :
* address the lack of Wifi AP configuration in Google TV Settings
* built with Google Leanback framework
* interface very similar to Google TvSettings

Cons :
* uses private APIs that may not be available on devices
* doesnt work on some devices (see incompatible device list) - require AOSP patches to fix Wifi Tethering (didnt work on first releases)
* doesnt work on Android M due to `android.provider.Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_WRITE_SETTINGS` intent which is required to be exposed by a System Activity. On Android TV, Google `Settings` applications is not present, only `TvSettings` application is installed which doesnt have this intent

## Compatible devices

* Bbox Miami (5.1.1)

## Incompatible devices

* Sony Bravia 4K (5.1.1)

There seems to have a System service restarting Wifi automatically every second preventing AP to setup :
```
I/BluetoothResetService_v3.11: check wifi and bt status
I/BluetoothResetService_v3.11: checkWifiBtStatus
E/BluetoothResetService_nat_v1.8: run ioctl  fail : Network is down (100)
I/BluetoothResetService_nat_v1.8: bt driver status = 1, if reture 0, bt framework need reset
I/BluetoothResetService_v3.11: bt and wifi Status is normal, nothing to do
```

<hr/>

* Philips 32PFH5500 (5.1.1)
* Freebox Mini 4K (5.0.2)
* Nexus Player Android 5.0/5.1.1

We have an error coming from AP configuration at `netd` level on these devices :
```
E/WifiStateMachine: Exception in softap start java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: command '50 softap fwreload wlan0 AP' failed with '501 50 SoftAP command has failed'
E/WifiStateMachine: Exception in softap re-start java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: command '52 softap fwreload wlan0 STA' failed with '501 52 SoftAP command has failed'
```

## Not tested

* Nvidia Shield (5.1.1)

## External Lib

* `accesspoint` library by Daniel Mart√≠ from https://github.com/mvdan/accesspoint for managing access point and retrieving connected client
* `leanback-v17` with some example provided here : https://github.com/googlesamples/androidtv-Leanback and https://github.com/stari4ek/androidtv-Leanback
